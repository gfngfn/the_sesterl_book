# How to install

Under the condition that Dune (â‰¥ 2.5) and OPAM are installed, invoke:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/gfngfn/Sesterl.git
$ cd Sesterl
$ opam pin add sesterl .
  # Probably this command asks you whether to install the package (and its dependencies).
  # You may answer Y to do so.
$ sesterl --version
```
